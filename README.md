# Street_and_Footpath
A website for reporting sidewalk and road problems and following up on solutions.

The work on the website is divided into two types: user and administrator.

Users can access the platform to view issues reported by other users and track the progress of issue resolution. If they wish to report their own problems, they need to register an account to log their issues and follow up on the progress.

Administrators, on the other hand, can view reports submitted by users and have the authority to modify the status of these reports.
